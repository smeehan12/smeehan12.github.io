            I have worked at institutions around the globe with people coming from a diverse array of 
            backgrounds.  In all aspects of my life, I strive to improve the welfare of every individual 
            and our global community while empowering others to do likewise. I think I do this best

            <p>I have a PhD in particle physics which I pursued out of an intrinsic curiosity to understand the fundamental laws of nature.  During the course of 12 years of study and post-doctoral research, I developed the ability to manipulate and understand big data sets, to construct and operate high speed electronics, and draw meaningful insights into the natural world.

            <p>In tandem, I have cultivated a set of “soft skills” resulting from the environment in which my work took place.  Particle physics is a domain which involves large international collaborations, is both cooperative and competitive, and inherently relies on individuals learning (and teaching) while pursuing their researching.  As such, I have developed strong sense of time management and group leadership skills.  I know how to prioritize my work to pursue multiple projects in parallel and guide a team to success.  I know how to communicate and how to facilitate communication both within a team and I know the value of mentoring colleagues and cultivating talent.</p>

              <p>I enjoy talking and I enjoy learning and I value the freedom of expression.  I appreciate family, friends, and colleagues who are willing to share what they know and willing to challenge that which I think I know.  I have come to embrace the paradigm of institutional disconfirmation (i.e. healthy skepticism) and feel that this forms a constructive cornerstone for every discussion, professional or otherwise.  My scientific training has provided me with a strong intuition for separating fact from opinion, rooting arguments in fact and reason, and acknowledging when my own belief should be updated.</p>

          This is an abbreviated list of my formal education and professional path. In many cases it highlights only superficial details (i.e. where, when, what ...) and as formative as academic and 
          work experience can be, and for me has been, I feel its important to always remember that much more than what can go on paper makes an individual.

          <p>I am, by training, an academic. To me, this means both pursuing and creating knowledge while cultivating it in others.  My curiosity led me to pursue physics and it persists to boggle my mind that we can begin to comprehend the natural world (... let alone anything).  But all of this is pointless without the welfare of "the other".  As such, I have intrinsically been drawn to activities and initiatives involving other people.  My professional pursuits can broadly be thought of as following three intermingled prongs.</p>

                    <p>I search for new particles and forces (e.g. dark matter) not currently described in the paradigm of particle physics by studying the data collected by the experiment. This requires translating physical intuition and an appreciation for the abilities (and limitations) of a physical detector into performant computer programs.  These programs are integrated with the millions of lines of code within the collaboration’s analysis framework, and used to process large datasets using a grid of cloud computing resources distributed around the world. </p>

                    <p>I work to automate the data analysis that we do by developing declarative, pipelined workflows.  This not only allows for the same code to be used multiple times in the context of physics searches to make new and interesting statements about hypothetical scenarios, but can also take the busy work out of standard (but complex!) detector calibration procedures.  This  improves efficiency of analysis turnaround and frees up the time of others in the collaboration to think more creatively. </p>

                    <p>I spend a considerable amount of time thinking about “hadronic jets”, which are collimated sprays of dozens of particles.  The way these particles orient themselves with respect to each other, their “topology”, can tell you a lot about the type of particle from which they originated at the collision point in a bubble whose radius is about one femtometer (one one thousandth of a millionth the width of a human hair).  Understanding their behavior requires not only physical intuition and programming but often times the use of machine learning. </p>

                    <p>I search for new particles and forces (e.g. dark matter) not currently described in the paradigm of particle physics by studying the data collected by the experiment. This requires translating physical intuition and an appreciation for the abilities (and limitations) of a physical detector into performant computer programs.  These programs are integrated with the millions of lines of code within the collaboration’s analysis framework, and used to process large datasets using a grid of cloud computing resources distributed around the world. </p>

This not only allows for the same code to be used multiple times in the context of physics searches to make new and interesting statements about hypothetical scenarios, but can also take the busy work out of standard (but complex!) detector calibration procedures.  This  improves efficiency of analysis turnaround and frees up the time of others in the collaboration to think more creatively. </p>

The way these particles orient themselves with respect to each other, their “topology”, can tell you a lot about the type of particle from which they originated at the collision point in a bubble whose radius is about one femtometer (one one thousandth of a millionth the width of a human hair).  Understanding their behavior requires not only physical intuition and programming but often times the use of machine learning. </p>

                  <h2>but don't take my word for it ...</h2>
                  <p>Ultimately, what gives me the greatest professional satisfaction is working with others towards a common goal.  I enjoy learning along the way but helping them succeed is what always “makes it worth it” for me.  This is particularly true in the case of students. I have worked with students, scientists and professionals from around the world.  They know my attitude and approach towards achieving my own goals, helping others do likewise, and seeing the joys of life whilst doing so.  Feel free to reach out to any of them if you would like to know about me and ask them to be honest, I know they all can be.</p>

Whether a quick 5k after work or a marathon 50k daylong haul, every run provides an opportunity for an insight into life.  And though getting to the end is not always pretty (or possible) getting out there is always worth it, even for a beer mile.</p>

The myriad of 21st century challenges necessitates a rapid increase in the standard of living throughout the African continent in a sustainable way.  This is an intentional focal point of my professional life and enriches my entire life in many ways.  </p>

                                <p>I believe that local communities and face-to-face interactions (i.e. neighbors) serve as an integral part of society. And for communities to be successful, they must be cultivated.  I enjoy that this can happen while doing something constructive (e.g. hauling firewood) that helps in a focused and pragmatic way.  Though I also appreciate, and let’s face it I often prefer, when this happens over a pint of beer or by sharing a meal and breaking bread together.</p>
